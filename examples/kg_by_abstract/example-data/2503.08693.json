    "abstract": "We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely designed liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that incorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we introduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations of traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling illiquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We demonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for cryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and reduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is validated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance (LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.",
