| 2025-03-19 | HQNN-FSP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network for Regression-Based Financial Stock Market Prediction | Prashant Kumar Choudhary, Nouhaila Innan, Muhammad Shafique et.al. | [2503.15403](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15403) |  | 11 pages and 11 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Financial time-series forecasting remains a challenging task due to complex temporal dependencies and market fluctuations. This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</details> |

We derive Wald statistics for linear restrictions and assess their performance. The statistics remains robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.</details> |
| 2025-03-06 | Matrix H-theory approach to stock market fluctuations | Luan M. T. de Moraes, Ant√¥nio M. S. Macedo, Raydonal Ospina et.al. | [2503.08697](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08697) |  | 26 pages, 10 figures. Published on Physical Review E | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce matrix H theory, a framework for analyzing collective behavior arising from multivariate stochastic processes with hierarchical structure. The theory models the joint distribution of the multiple variables (the measured signal) as a compound of a large-scale multivariate distribution with the distribution of a slowly fluctuating background. The background is characterized by a hierarchical stochastic evolution of internal degrees of freedom, representing the correlations between stocks at different time scales. As in its univariate version, the matrix H-theory formalism also has two universality classes: Wishart and inverse Wishart, enabling a concise description of both the background and the signal probability distributions in terms of Meijer G-functions with matrix argument. Empirical analysis of daily returns of stocks within the S&P500 demonstrates the effectiveness of matrix H theory in describing fluctuations in stock markets. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multivariate hierarchical processes and offer potential for developing more informed portfolio strategies in financial markets.</details> |
| 2025-03-05 | Multimodal Stock Price Prediction: A Case Study of the Russian Securities Market | Kasymkhan Khubiev, Mikhail Semenov et.al. | [2503.08696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08696) |  | NSCF-2024, PROGRAM SYSTEMS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Classical asset price forecasting methods primarily rely on numerical data, such as price time series, trading volumes, limit order book data, and technical analysis indicators. However, the news flow plays a significant role in price formation, making the development of multimodal approaches that combine textual and numerical data for improved prediction accuracy highly relevant. This paper addresses the problem of forecasting financial asset prices using the multimodal approach that combines candlestick time series and textual news flow data. A unique dataset was collected for the study, which includes time series for 176 Russian stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange and 79,555 financial news articles in Russian. For processing textual data, pre-trained models RuBERT and Vikhr-Qwen2.5-0.5b-Instruct (a large language model) were used, while time series and vectorized text data were processed using an LSTM recurrent neural network. The experiments compared models based on a single modality (time series only) and two modalities, as well as various methods for aggregating text vector representations. Prediction quality was estimated using two key metrics: Accuracy (direction of price movement prediction: up or down) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which measures the deviation of the predicted price from the true price. The experiments showed that incorporating textual modality reduced the MAPE value by 55%. The resulting multimodal dataset holds value for the further adaptation of language models in the financial sector. Future research directions include optimizing textual modality parameters, such as the time window, sentiment, and chronological order of news messages.</details> |
| 2025-03-02 | Liquidity-adjusted Return and Volatility, and Autoregressive Models | Qi Deng, Zhong-guo Zhou et.al. | [2503.08693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08693) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely designed liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that incorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we introduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations of traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling illiquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We demonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for cryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and reduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is validated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance (LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.</details> |
| 2025-02-27 | Detecting Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes: A Thresholding-Based Approach to Handling Market Noise | Mahya Karbalaii et.al. | [2503.08692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08692) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a simple yet robust unsupervised model to detect pump-and-dump events on tokens listed on the Poloniex Exchange platform. By combining threshold-based criteria with exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and volatility measures, our approach effectively distinguishes genuine anomalies from minor trading fluctuations, even for tokens with low liquidity and prolonged inactivity. These characteristics present a unique challenge, as standard anomaly-detection methods often over-flag negligible volume spikes. Our framework overcomes this issue by tailoring both price and volume thresholds to the specific trading patterns observed, resulting in a model that balances high true-positive detection with minimal noise.</details> |
| 2025-03-18 | Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment? | Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano et.al. | [2503.03612](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612) |  | There are two different articles with the same content and different   names (see arXiv:2412.19245) | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | VWAP Execution with Signature-Enhanced Transformers: A Multi-Asset Learning Approach | Remi Genet et.al. | [2503.02680](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02680) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/DynamicVWAPTransformer)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper I propose a novel approach to Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution that addresses two key practical challenges: the need for asset-specific model training and the capture of complex temporal dependencies. Building upon my recent work in dynamic VWAP execution arXiv:2502.18177, I demonstrate that a single neural network trained across multiple assets can achieve performance comparable to or better than traditional asset-specific models. The proposed architecture combines a transformer-based design inspired by arXiv:2406.02486 with path signatures for capturing geometric features of price-volume trajectories, as in arXiv:2406.17890. The empirical analysis, conducted on hourly cryptocurrency trading data from 80 trading pairs, shows that the globally-fitted model with signature features (GFT-Sig) achieves superior performance in both absolute and quadratic VWAP loss metrics compared to asset-specific approaches. Notably, these improvements persist for out-of-sample assets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different market conditions. The results suggest that combining global parameter sharing with signature-based feature extraction provides a scalable and robust approach to VWAP execution, offering significant practical advantages over traditional asset-specific implementations.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market | Katarzyna Chƒôƒá, Bartosz Uniejewski, Rafa≈Ç Weron et.al. | [2503.02518](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</details> |
| 2025-03-01 | Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures | Hari P. Krishnan, Stephan Sturm et.al. | [2503.00603](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603) |  | 19 pages, 1 figure | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead | Richard Gerlach, Antonio Naimoli, Giuseppe Storti et.al. | [2502.20978](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</details> |
| 2025-02-26 | Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph | Shiqi Wang, Zhibo Zhang, Libing Fang et.al. | [2502.19305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305) | **[link](https://github.com/wangskyGit/KeHGN-R)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning ( ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks | Remi Genet et.al. | [2502.18177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/deepdynamicvwap)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | LLM Knows Geometry Better than Algebra: Numerical Understanding of LLM-Based Agents in A Trading Arena | Tianmi Ma, Jiawei Du, Wenxin Huang et.al. | [2502.17967](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967) | **[link](https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/agent-trading-arena)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to generalize to dynamic, unseen tasks, particularly in numerical reasoning, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LLMs on problems with predefined optimal solutions, which may not align with real-world scenarios where clear answers are absent. To bridge this gap, we design the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual numerical game simulating complex economic systems through zero-sum games, where agents invest in stock portfolios. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic reasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local details rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly better with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as scatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance numerical reasoning. This capability is further improved by incorporating the reflection module, which aids in the analysis and interpretation of complex data. We validate our findings on NASDAQ Stock dataset, where LLMs demonstrate stronger reasoning with visual data compared to text. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.git.</details> |
| 2025-02-24 | A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk | Jan Fialkowski, Christian Diem, Andr√°s Borsos et.al. | [2502.17044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044) | **[link](https://github.com/JanFialkowski/FSRI_Plus)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and financial systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-22 | Contrastive Similarity Learning for Market Forecasting: The ContraSim Framework | Nicholas Vinden, Raeid Saqur, Zining Zhu et.al. | [2502.16023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16023) |  | 8 pages, 3 appendices | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce the Contrastive Similarity Space Embedding Algorithm (ContraSim), a novel framework for uncovering the global semantic relationships between daily financial headlines and market movements. ContraSim operates in two key stages: (I) Weighted Headline Augmentation, which generates augmented financial headlines along with a semantic fine-grained similarity score, and (II) Weighted Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (WSSCL), an extended version of classical self-supervised contrastive learning that uses the similarity metric to create a refined weighted embedding space. This embedding space clusters semantically similar headlines together, facilitating deeper market insights. Empirical results demonstrate that integrating ContraSim features into financial forecasting tasks improves classification accuracy from WSJ headlines by 7%. Moreover, leveraging an information density analysis, we find that the similarity spaces constructed by ContraSim intrinsically cluster days with homogeneous market movement directions, indicating that ContraSim captures market dynamics independent of ground truth labels. Additionally, ContraSim enables the identification of historical news days that closely resemble the headlines of the current day, providing analysts with actionable insights to predict market trends by referencing analogous past events.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Multi-Agent Stock Prediction Systems: Machine Learning Models, Simulations, and Real-Time Trading Strategies | Daksh Dave, Gauransh Sawhney, Vikhyat Chauhan et.al. | [2502.15853](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15853) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper presents a comprehensive study on stock price prediction, leveragingadvanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve financial forecasting accuracy. The research evaluates the performance of various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and attention-based models. These models are assessed for their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies inherent in stock market data. Our findings show that attention-based models outperform other architectures, achieving the highest accuracy by capturing both short and long-term dependencies. This study contributes valuable insights into AI-driven financial forecasting, offering practical guidance for developing more accurate and efficient trading systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM) | Tianzuo Hu et.al. | [2502.15822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</details> |

(2024). Network Topology of the Euro Area Interbank Market. In:   Mingione, M., Vichi, M., Zaccaria, G. (eds) *High-quality and Timely   Statistics*. CESS 2022. Studies in Theoretical and Applied Statistics.   Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63630-1_1 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets | Bastien Buchwalter, Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz et.al. | [2502.15458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework | Arno Botha, Tanja Verster, Roland Breedt et.al. | [2502.14479](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479) |  | 33 pages, 8192 words, 12 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Causality Analysis of COVID-19 Induced Crashes in Stock and Commodity Markets: A Topological Perspective | Buddha Nath Sharma, Anish Rai, SR Luwang et.al. | [2502.14431](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14431) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The paper presents a comprehensive causality analysis of the US stock and commodity markets during the COVID-19 crash. The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</details> |

(SISC, V.43, 2021), named Deep Splitting method since they trained the Neural Networks step by step in the time direction. In this paper, we propose a new training approach with two different features. Firstly, neural networks are trained at all time steps globally, instead of step by step. Secondly, the training data are generated in a new way, in which the method is consistent with a direct Monte Carlo scheme when dealing with a linear parabolic PDE. Numerical examples show that our method has significant improvement both in efficiency and accuracy.</details> |

Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</details> |

Network analysis has emerged as a valuable approach in this context.   In this paper, we present WeirdFlows, a top-down search pipeline for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions and non-compliant agents. In a transaction network, fraud attempts are often based on complex transaction patterns that change over time to avoid detection. The WeirdFlows pipeline requires neither an a priori set of patterns nor a training set. In addition, by providing elements to explain the anomalies found, it facilitates and supports the work of an AFC analyst.   We evaluate WeirdFlows on a dataset from Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP) bank, comprising 80 million cross-country transactions over 15 months, benchmarking our implementation of the algorithm. The results, corroborated by ISP AFC experts, highlight its effectiveness in identifying suspicious transactions and actors, particularly in the context of the economic sanctions imposed in the EU after February 2022. This demonstrates \textit{WeirdFlows}' capability to handle large datasets, detect complex transaction patterns, and provide the necessary interpretability for formal AFC investigations.</details> |

Mandal et.al. | [2503.15700](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15700) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The individual contributions of pH and chloride concentration to the corrosion kinetics of bioabsorbable magnesium (Mg) alloys remain unresolved despite their significant roles as driving factors in Mg corrosion. This study demonstrates and quantifies hitherto unknown separate effects of pH and chloride content on the corrosion of Mg alloys pertinent to biomedical implant applications. The experimental setup designed for this purpose enables the quantification of the dependence of corrosion on pH and chloride concentration. The in vitro tests conclusively demonstrate that variations in chloride concentration, relevant to biomedical applications, have a negligible effect on corrosion kinetics. The findings identify pH as a critical factor in the corrosion of bioabsorbable Mg alloys. A variationally consistent phase-field model is developed for assessing the degradation of Mg alloys in biological fluids. The model accurately predicts the corrosion performance of Mg alloys observed during the experiments, including their dependence on pH and chloride concentration. The capability of the framework to account for mechano-chemical effects during corrosion is demonstrated in practical orthopaedic applications considering bioabsorbable Mg alloy implants for bone fracture fixation and porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The strategy has the potential to assess the in vitro and in vivo service life of bioabsorbable Mg-based biomedical devices.</details> |

The paper outlines DSD's key principles, discusses its role in enabling digital twin technology, and argues for its importance in modern engineering education. By adopting DSD, engineers can create more intelligent and adaptable systems that leverage real-time data for continuous design iteration, operational optimisation and data-driven predictive maintenance.</details> |

Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input-output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.</details> |

Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacteria species and 3 yeast-like fungi from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of positive blood samples from sepsis patients.   A total of 16,637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. The analysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Nakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due to high morphotic diversity.   The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification, but it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the training data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial diagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis treatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results presented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the European Patent Office EP24461637.1 "A computer implemented method for identifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor".</details> |

TAPS can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalent zetta-scale ( $10^{21}$) degrees of freedom (DoFs). TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, an arbitrary convergence rate can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process as an example and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with $3.46$ billion spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others.</details> |

Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$ . In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</details> |

The bosonic atoms are assumed to be condensed and are described by the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The fermionic atoms, on the other hand, are treated individually, and each atom is associated with a wave function whose evolution follows the Hartree-Fock equation. We solve such a formulated set of equations using a variety of methods, including those based on adiabatic switching of interactions and the imaginary time propagation technique combined with the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization or the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. We show how different algorithms compete at the numerical level by studying the mixture in the range of parameters covering the formation of self-bound quantum Bose-Fermi droplets.</details> |

In structural biology there are now numerous open repositories of experimental and simulated datasets. Being able to easily access and utilise these is crucial for allowing researchers to make optimal use of their research effort. The tools presented here are useful for collating existing public cryoEM datasets and/or creating new synthetic cryoEM datasets to aid the development of novel data processing and interpretation algorithms. In recent years, structural biology has seen the development of a multitude of machine-learning based algorithms for aiding numerous steps in the processing and reconstruction of experimental datasets and the use of these approaches has become widespread. Developing such techniques in structural biology requires access to large datasets which can be cumbersome to curate and unwieldy to make use of. In this paper we present a suite of Python software packages which we collectively refer to as PERC (profet, EMPIARreader and CAKED). These are designed to reduce the burden which data curation places upon structural biology research. The protein structure fetcher (profet) package allows users to conveniently download and cleave sequences or structures from the Protein Data Bank or Alphafold databases. EMPIARreader allows lazy loading of Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive datasets in a machine-learning compatible structure. The Class Aggregator for Key Electron-microscopy Data (CAKED) package is designed to seamlessly facilitate the training of machine learning models on electron microscopy data, including electron-cryo-microscopy-specific data augmentation and labelling. These packages may be utilised independently or as building blocks in workflows. All are available in open source repositories and designed to be easily extensible to facilitate more advanced workflows if required.</details> |

Both electromagnetic and thermal analyses are relevant for foil windings. These two physical areas are coupled through Joule losses and temperature dependent material properties. For an efficient simulation of foil windings, homogenization techniques are used to avoid resolving the single turns. Therefore, this paper comprises a coupled magneto-thermal simulation that uses a homogenization method in the electromagnetic and thermal part. A weak coupling with different time step sizes for both parts is presented. The method is validated on a simple geometry and showcased for a pot transformer that uses a foil and a wire winding.</details> |

Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation.</details> |

However, traditional classification metrics often fail to account for imbalanced data, varying performance across cohorts, and patient-level inconsistencies, leading to biased evaluations. We propose the Cohort-Attention Evaluation Metrics (CAT) framework to address these challenges. CAT introduces patient-level assessment, entropy-based distribution weighting, and cohort-weighted sensitivity and specificity. Key metrics like CATSensitivity (CATSen), CATSpecificity (CATSpe), and CATMean ensure balanced and fair evaluation across diverse populations. This approach enhances predictive reliability, fairness, and interpretability, providing a robust evaluation method for AI-driven medical screening models.</details> |

Constitutive neural networks allow for the automated discovery of constitutive models that exactly satisfy physical laws given experimental testing data, but are only capable of predicting the mean stress response. Stochastic methods treat each weight as a random variable and are capable of learning their probability distributions. Bayesian constitutive neural networks combine both methods, but their weights lack physical interpretability and we must sample each weight from a probability distribution to train or evaluate the model. Here we introduce a more interpretable network with fewer parameters, simpler training, and the potential to discover correlated weights: Gaussian constitutive neural networks. We demonstrate the performance of our new Gaussian network on biaxial testing data, and discover a sparse and interpretable four-term model with correlated weights. Importantly, the discovered distributions of material parameters across a set of samples can serve as priors to discover better constitutive models for new samples with limited data. We anticipate that Gaussian constitutive neural networks are a natural first step towards generative constitutive models informed by physical laws and parameter uncertainty.</details> |

Hageman et.al. | [2503.12481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12481) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Iceberg calving at glacier termini results in mass loss from ice sheets, but the associated fracture mechanics is often poorly represented using simplistic (empirical or elementary mechanics-based) failure criteria. Here, we propose an advanced Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that drives cracking based on the visco-elastic stress state in ice. This criterion is implemented in a phase field fracture framework, and finite element simulations are conducted to determine the critical conditions that can trigger ice cliff collapse. Results demonstrate that fast-moving glaciers with negligible basal friction are prone to tensile failure causing crevasse propagation far away from the ice front; whilst slow-moving glaciers with significant basal friction are likely to exhibit shear failure near the ice front. Results also indicate that seawater pressure plays a major role in modulating cliff failure. For land terminating glaciers, full thickness cliff failure is observed if the glacier exceeds a critical height, dependent on cohesive strength $\tau_\mathrm{c}$ ($H \approx 120\;\text{m}$ for $\tau_\mathrm{c}=0.5\;\text{MPa}$). For marine-terminating glaciers, ice cliff failure occurs if a critical glacier free-board ($H-h_\mathrm{w}$) is exceeded, with ice slumping only observed above the ocean-water height; for $\tau_\mathrm{c} = 0.5\;\text{MPa}$, the model-predicted critical free-board is $H-h_\mathrm{w} \approx 215\;\text{m}$ , which is in good agreement with field observations. While the critical free-board height is larger than that predicted by some previous models, we cannot conclude that marine ice cliff instability is less likely because we do not include other failure processes such as hydrofracture of basal crevasses and plastic necking.</details> |

It has been demonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR fuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state processes. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow Accident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the transition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within the reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved, corrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the effects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.   A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric unit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This mesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells for such configurations. Simulation results show that SubChCFD effectively captures the thermal hydraulic behaviours of the reactor during a LOFA transient, producing predictions in good agreement with RANS simulations while significantly reducing computational cost.</details> |

Marzouk et.al. | [2503.11826](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11826) |  | 8 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables, peer-reviewed journal paper, open   access | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Adiabatic Flame Temperature (AFT) in combustion represents the maximum attainable temperature at which the chemical energy in the reactant fuel is converted into sensible heat in combustion products without heat loss. AFT depends on the fuel, oxidizer, and chemical composition of the products. Computing AFT requires solving either a nonlinear equation or a larger minimization problem. This study obtained the AFTs for oxy-methane (methane and oxygen), oxy-hydrogen (hydrogen and oxygen), air-methane (methane and air), and air-hydrogen (hydrogen and air) for stoichiometric conditions. The reactant temperature was 298.15 K (25{\deg}C), and the pressure was kept constant at 1 atm. Two reaction mechanisms were attempted: a global single-step irreversible reaction for complete combustion and the GRI-Mech 3.0 elementary mechanism (53 species, 325 steps) for chemical equilibrium with its associated thermodynamic data. NASA CEARUN was the main modeling tool used. Two other tools were used for benchmarking: an Excel and a Cantera-Python implementation of GRI-Mech 3.0. The results showed that the AFTs for oxy-methane were 5,166.47 K (complete combustion) and 3,050.12 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,326.35 K and 2,224.25 K for air-methane, respectively. The AFTs for oxy-hydrogen were 4,930.56 K (complete combustion) and 3,074.51 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,520.33 K and 2,378.62 K for air-hydrogen, respectively. For eight combustion modeling cases, the relative deviation between the AFTs predicted by CEARUN and GRI-Mech 3.0 ranged from 0.064% to 3.503%.</details> |

HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.</details> |

While the kernel gradient correction (KGC) method is commonly applied in structural domains to enhance numerical consistency, high-order consistency corrections that preserve conservation remain underutilized in fluid domains despite their critical role in FSI analysis, especially for the multi-resolution scheme where fluid domains generally have a low resolution. In this study, we incorporate the reverse kernel gradient correction (RKGC) formulation, a conservative high-order consistency approximation, into the fluid discretization for solving FSI problems. RKGC has been proven to achieve exact second-order convergence with relaxed particles and improve numerical accuracy while particularly enhancing energy conservation in free-surface flow simulations. By integrating this correction into the Riemann SPH method to solve different typical FSI problems with a multi-resolution scheme, numerical results consistently show improvements in accuracy and convergence compared to uncorrected fluid discretization. Despite these advances, further refinement of correction techniques for solid domains and fluid-structure interfaces remains significant for enhancing the overall accuracy of SPH-based FSI modeling and simulation.</details> |

In this paper, we demonstrated the efficacy of BERTweet, a variant of BERT pre-trained specifically on a Twitter corpus, and the transformer architecture by achieving competitive performance with the existing literature and setting a new baseline for Matthews Correlation Coefficient on the Stocknet dataset without auxiliary data sources.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | Design and Analysis of an Extreme-Scale, High-Performance, and Modular Agent-Based Simulation Platform | Lukas Johannes Breitwieser et.al. | [2503.10796](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10796) |  | PhD Thesis submitted to ETH Zurich | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Agent-based modeling is indispensable for studying complex systems across many domains. However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources.   This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works.   First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code.   Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server.   Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.   BioDynaMo has been widely adopted, including a prize-winning radiotherapy simulation recognized as a top 10 breakthrough in physics in 2024.</details> |

However, due to limitations in the equation solving capacity, the integration of monitoring and modeling has been suffering suboptimal statistical approaches. This limitation results in models that can only partially leverage monitoring data, thus being an obstacle for realistic uncertainty assessments by overlooking critical correlations between both measurements and model parameters. This study presents a novel solution that integrates catchment monitoring and a unified hieratical statistical catchment modeling that employs a log-normal distribution for residuals within a left-censored likelihood function to address measurements below detection limits. This enables the estimation of concentrations within sub-catchments in conjunction with a source/fate sub-catchment model and monitoring data. This approach is possible due to a model builder R package denoted RTMB. The proposed approach introduces a statistical paradigm based on a hierarchical structure, capable of accommodating heterogeneous sampling across various sampling locations and the authors suggest that this also will encourage further refinement of other existing modeling platforms within the scientific community to improve synergy with monitoring programs. The application of the method is demonstrated through an analysis of nickel concentrations in Danish surface waters.</details> |

However, they remain computationally expensive when high accuracy requires large least squares problems to be solved. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for ELMs have allowed parallel computation to reduce training times of large systems. This paper constructs a coarse space for ELMs, which enables further acceleration of their training. By partitioning interface variables into coarse and non-coarse variables, selective elimination introduces a Schur complement system on the non-coarse variables with the coarse problem embedded. Key to the performance of the proposed method is a Neumann-Neumann acceleration that utilizes the coarse space. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup compared to a previous DDM method for ELMs.</details> |

To address these limitations, this study explores the usage of the newly introduced Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM) network in combination with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for automated stock trading. Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems.</details> |

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</details> |

To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them. Experimental validations on a center console assembly task demonstrate significant improvements in cycle times and robustness compared to conventional robot programming approaches.

| 2025-03-12 | Large-scale Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser Beam Welding Using High-Performance Computing: A Qualitative Reproduction of Experimental Results | Tommaso Bevilacqua, Andrey Gumenyuk, Niloufar Habibi et.al. | [2503.09345](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09345) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Laser beam welding is a non-contact joining technique that has gained significant importance in the course of the increasing degree of automation in industrial manufacturing. This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.   The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</details> |

In order to solve performance problems, a Level Of Detail solution has been developed. These methods are based on the earlier work introduced by J. Clark in 1976. In this paper we introduce a particle method used for this work and subsequently we explain different simplification methods we have applied to improve our solution.</details> |
| 2025-03-11 | Capturing Lifecycle System Degradation in Digital Twin Model Updating | Yifan Tang, Mostafa Rahmani Dehaghani, G. Gary Wang et.al. | [2503.08953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08953) |  | 32 pages, 25 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate monitoring, control, and other decision-making tasks in real-world engineering systems. Online update methods have been proposed to update DT models. Considering the degradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT models to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over time. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters have been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation parameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments. To mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for DT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses without any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system. The core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the lifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters with a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong update process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters of all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into account the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation stage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation stages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables prediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted latent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is reconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system responses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on two engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could capture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle.</details> |

Nathan Kutz et.al. | [2503.08904](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904) | **[link](https://github.com/ermete-lab/nushred)** | arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.12550 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</details> |

Kerswell et.al. | [2503.08283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283) | **[link](https://github.com/dakling/jax-spectral-dns)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</details> |

This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</details> |

Tessone et.al. | [2503.07834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07834) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Uniswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automatic token exchange without the need for traditional order books. Every pair of tokens forms a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and each token can be paired with any other token to create liquidity pools. This characteristic motivates us to employ a complex network approach to analyze the features of the Uniswap market. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the Uniswap network using complex network methods. The network on October 31, 2023, is built to observe its recent features, showcasing both scale-free and core-periphery properties. By employing node and edge-betweenness metrics, we detect the most important tokens and liquidity pools. Additionally, we construct daily networks spanning from the beginning of Uniswap V2 on May 5, 2020, until October 31, 2023, and our findings demonstrate that the network becomes increasingly fragile over time. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis by simulating the deletion of nodes to estimate the impact of some extreme events such as the Terra collapse. The results indicate that the Uniswap network exhibits robustness, yet it is notably fragile when deleting tokens with high betweenness centrality. This finding highlights that, despite being a decentralized exchange, Uniswap exhibits significant centralization tendencies in terms of token network connectivity and the distribution of TVL across nodes (tokens) and edges (liquidity pools).</details> |

For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms.   This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Bearing Fault Detection using Piezoelectric Cantilevers | P. Peralta-Braz, M. M. Alamdari, C. T. Chou et.al. | [2503.07462](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07462) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, yet their vulnerability to faults often leads to costly breakdowns. Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.</details> |

These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.</details> |

The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$ -consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case. Through different numerical applications involving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation possesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex systems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy.</details> |

With digital fabrication technology, this study explores the transition from traditional, single function building facades to multifunctional, integrated building systems. It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) fa\c{c}ade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation. This research introduces a novel approach by designing the fa\c{c}ade system as modular, user-friendly and transportation-friendly bricks, enabling the creation of a user-customized and self-assembled photobioreactor (PBR) system. The single module in the system is proposed to be "neutralization bricks", which embedded with algae and equipped with an air circulation system, facilitating the photobioreactor (PBR)'s functionality. A connection system between modules allows for easy assembly by users, while a limited variety of brick styles ensures modularity in manufacturing without sacrificing customization and diversity. The system is also equipped with an advanced microalgae status detection algorithm, which allows users to monitor the condition of the microalgae using monocular camera. This functionality ensures timely alerts and notifications for users to replace the algae, thereby optimizing the operational efficiency and sustainability of the algae cultivation process.</details> |

These power losses not only increase end-to-end latency, but also compromise inference consistency and accuracy, as existing checkpointing and restore mechanisms are prone to errors. Consequently, the quality of service (QoS) for DNN inference on EH devices is severely impacted. In this paper, we propose an energy-adaptive DNN inference mechanism capable of dynamically transitioning the model into a low-power mode by reducing computational complexity when harvested energy is limited. This approach ensures that end-to-end latency requirements are met. Additionally, to address the limitations of error-prone checkpoint-and-restore mechanisms, we introduce a checkpoint-free intermittent inference framework that ensures consistent, progress-preserving DNN inference during power failures in energy-harvesting systems.</details> |

Our trading agent is first trained for a specific time period and tested on new data and compared with the long-and-hold strategy as a benchmark (market). We analyze the differences between the various models and the in-sample/out-of-sample performance with respect to the environment. The experimental results show that the trading agent follows an appropriate behavior. It can adjust its policy to different circumstances, such as more extensive use of the neutral position when trading costs are present. Furthermore, the net asset value exceeded that of the benchmark, and the agent outperformed the market in the test set. We provide initial insights into the behavior of an agent in a financial domain using a DDQN algorithm. The results of this study can be used for further development.</details> |

In contrast to classical stochastic control theory and other analytical approaches for solving financial decision-making problems that heavily reply on model assumptions, new developments from reinforcement learning (RL) are able to make full use of the large amount of financial data with fewer model assumptions and to improve decisions in complex financial environments. This survey paper aims to review the recent developments and use of RL approaches in finance. We give an introduction to Markov decision processes, which is the setting for many of the commonly used RL approaches. Various algorithms are then introduced with a focus on value and policy based methods that do not require any model assumptions. Connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. Our survey concludes by discussing the application of these RL algorithms in a variety of decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing and hedging, market making, smart order routing, and robo-advising.</details> |

This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</details> |

This version is submitted to the 33rd   European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025), to be held in Isola   delle Femmine - Palermo - Italy, on September 8-12, 2025 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose Diffusion-Informed Model Predictive Control (D-I MPC), a generic framework for uncertainty-aware prediction and decision-making in partially observable stochastic systems by integrating diffusion-based time series forecasting models in Model Predictive Control algorithms. In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</details> |

These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows:   $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT).   $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation.   $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</details> |

This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</details> |

This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that advances time series forecasting for infectious diseases, with its application to COVID 19 data as a critical case study. Our hybrid approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission across diverse regions. The CNN extracts spatial features from raw epidemiological data, while the LSTM models temporal patterns, yielding precise and adaptable predictions. To maximize performance, we employ a hybrid optimization strategy combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to fine tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. Applied to COVID 19 case data from 24 countries across six continents, our method outperforms established benchmarks, including ARIMA and standalone LSTM models, with statistically significant gains in predictive accuracy (e.g., reduced RMSE). This framework demonstrates its potential as a versatile method for forecasting epidemic trends, offering insights for resource planning and decision making in both historical contexts, like the COVID 19 pandemic, and future outbreaks.</details> |

For example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models. Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained models, outperforming existing baselines.</details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty propagation | Pedro Pessoa, Paul Campitelli, Douglas P. Shepherd et.al. | [2503.10873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873) | **[link](https://github.com/pessoap/mamba-probtsf)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | Towards Efficient Large Scale Spatial-Temporal Time Series Forecasting via Improved Inverted Transformers | Jiarui Sun, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yujie Fan et.al. | [2503.10858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10858) |  | 10 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Time series forecasting at scale presents significant challenges for modern prediction systems, particularly when dealing with large sets of synchronized series, such as in a global payment network. In such systems, three key challenges must be overcome for accurate and scalable predictions: 1) emergence of new entities, 2) disappearance of existing entities, and 3) the large number of entities present in the data. The recently proposed Inverted Transformer (iTransformer) architecture has shown promising results by effectively handling variable entities. However, its practical application in large-scale settings is limited by quadratic time and space complexity ( $O(N^2)$) with respect to the number of entities $N$. In this paper, we introduce EiFormer, an improved inverted transformer architecture that maintains the adaptive capabilities of iTransformer while reducing computational complexity to linear scale ($O(N)$ ). Our key innovation lies in restructuring the attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations without sacrificing model expressiveness. Additionally, we incorporate a random projection mechanism that not only enhances efficiency but also improves prediction accuracy through better feature representation. Extensive experiments on the public LargeST benchmark dataset and a proprietary large-scale time series dataset demonstrate that EiFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy. Our approach enables practical deployment of transformer-based forecasting in industrial applications where handling time series at scale is essential.</details> |

Most classical statistical models may have certain limitations when applied to practical scenarios in fields such as energy, healthcare, traffic, meteorology, and economics, especially when high accuracy is required. With the continuous development of deep learning, numerous new models have emerged in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. However, existing surveys have not provided a unified summary of the wide range of model architectures in this field, nor have they given detailed summaries of works in feature extraction and datasets. To address this gap, in this review, we comprehensively study the previous works and summarize the general paradigms of Deep Time Series Forecasting (DTSF) in terms of model architectures. Besides, we take an innovative approach by focusing on the composition of time series and systematically explain important feature extraction methods. Additionally, we provide an overall compilation of datasets from various domains in existing works. Finally, we systematically emphasize the significant challenges faced and future research directions in this field.</details> |

Transformer effectively combines information from the past input and output samples in auto-regressive manner so that each sample becomes aware of all inputs and outputs. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling, the transformer processed samples become effective in predicting the next output. Time series forecasting is a Seq2Seq problem. The original architecture is defined for discrete input and output sequence tokens, but to adopt it for time series, the model must be adapted for continuous data. This work introduces minimal adaptations to make the original transformer architecture suitable for continuous value time series data.</details> |
| 2025-03-12 | LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics | Jialiang Tang, Shuo Chen, Chen Gong et.al. | [2503.09656](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09656) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is critical in many real-world domains like financial planning and health monitoring. Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</details> |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</details> |
| 2025-03-11 | MFRS: A Multi-Frequency Reference Series Approach to Scalable and Accurate Time-Series Forecasting | Liang Yu, Lai Tu, Xiang Bai et.al. | [2503.08328](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08328) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Multivariate time-series forecasting holds immense value across diverse applications, requiring methods to effectively capture complex temporal and inter-variable dynamics. A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic patterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on network architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies. Inspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series predictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different frequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method based on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through spectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral components and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series. Unlike signal decomposition, which represents the original series as a linear combination of basis signals, our method uses a transformer model to compute cross-attention between the original series and reference series, capturing essential features for forecasting. Experiments on major open and synthetic datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by focusing on attention with a small number of reference series rather than pairwise variable attention, our method ensures scalability and broad applicability.

| 2025-03-11 | LangTime: A Language-Guided Unified Model for Time Series Forecasting with Proximal Policy Optimization | Wenzhe Niu, Zongxia Xie, Yanru Sun et.al. | [2503.08271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08271) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</details> |
| 2025-03-06 | TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster | Kanghui Ning, Zijie Pan, Yu Liu et.al. | [2503.07649](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</details> |

However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Logic-Inspired Regularization | Jianqi Zhang, Jingyao Wang, Xingchen Shen et.al. | [2503.06867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06867) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in many applications. Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</details> |
| 2025-03-08 | A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM | Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu et.al. | [2503.06216](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06216) |  | 23 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</details> |

The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</details> |

However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

Wells et.al. | [2503.04956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04956) |  | 40 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper we propose a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem where the loss of a classification decision is only observed at a future time point after the classification decision has to be made. To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</details> |
| 2025-03-06 | Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning | Yiheng Ding, Gangnan Yuan, Dewei Zuo et.al. | [2503.04218](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade the price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices, aiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets.   With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging.   Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.   Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</details> |
| 2025-03-06 | TimeFound: A Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting | Congxi Xiao, Jingbo Zhou, Yixiong Xiao et.al. | [2503.04118](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04118) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present TimeFound, an encoder-decoder transformer-based time series foundation model for out-of-the-box zero-shot forecasting. To handle time series data from various domains, TimeFound employs a multi-resolution patching strategy to capture complex temporal patterns at multiple scales. We pre-train our model with two sizes (200M and 710M parameters) on a large time-series corpus comprising both real-world and synthetic datasets. Over a collection of unseen datasets across diverse domains and forecasting horizons, our empirical evaluations suggest that TimeFound can achieve superior or competitive zero-shot forecasting performance, compared to state-of-the-art time series foundation models.</details> |
| 2025-03-05 | Graph-Augmented LSTM for Forecasting Sparse Anomalies in Graph-Structured Time Series | Sneh Pillai et.al. | [2503.03729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03729) |  | 12 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Detecting anomalies in time series data is a critical task across many domains. The challenge intensifies when anomalies are sparse and the data are multivariate with relational dependencies across sensors or nodes. Traditional univariate anomaly detectors struggle to capture such cross-node dependencies, particularly in sparse anomaly settings. To address this, we propose a graph-augmented time series forecasting approach that explicitly integrates the graph of relationships among time series into an LSTM forecasting model. This enables the model to detect rare anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed in purely univariate approaches. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark datasets - the Yahoo Webscope S5 anomaly dataset and the METR-LA traffic sensor network - and compare the performance of the Graph-Augmented LSTM against LSTM-only, ARIMA, and Prophet baselines. Results demonstrate that the graph-augmented model achieves significantly higher precision and recall, improving F1-score by up to 10% over the best baseline</details> |
| 2025-03-09 | Small but Mighty: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Lightweight LLMs | Haoran Fan, Bin Li, Yixuan Weng et.al. | [2503.03594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03594) |  | 20 pages, 10 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in time series forecasting, their practical deployment remains constrained by excessive computational demands and memory footprints. Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.

| 2025-03-04 | SeqFusion: Sequential Fusion of Pre-Trained Models for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting | Ting-Ji Huang, Xu-Yang Chen, Han-Jia Ye et.al. | [2503.02836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02836) | **[link](https://github.com/Tingji2419/SeqFusion)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Unlike traditional time-series forecasting methods that require extensive in-task data for training, zero-shot forecasting can directly predict future values given a target time series without additional training data. Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Lightweight Channel-wise Dynamic Fusion Model: Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting via Entropy Analysis | Tianyu Jia, Zongxia Xie, Yanru Sun et.al. | [2503.02609](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02609) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Non-stationarity is an intrinsic property of real-world time series and plays a crucial role in time series forecasting. Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</details> |
| 2025-03-03 | Unify and Anchor: A Context-Aware Transformer for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting | Xiaobin Hong, Jiawen Zhang, Wenzhong Li et.al. | [2503.01157](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01157) |  | 20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, conference under review | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The rise of foundation models has revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, yet their best practices to time series forecasting remains underexplored. Existing time series foundation models often adopt methodologies from these fields without addressing the unique characteristics of time series data. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in cross-domain time series forecasting: the complexity of temporal patterns and semantic misalignment. To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContexTST advances state-of-the-art forecasting performance while achieving strong zero-shot transferability across diverse domains.</details> |
