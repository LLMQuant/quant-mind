**QuantMind** is an intelligent knowledge extraction and retrieval framework for quantitative finance. It transforms unstructured financial content‚Äîpapers, news, blogs, reports‚Äîinto a queryable knowledge base, enabling AI-powered research at scale.
### üßê Overview
QuantMind is a next-generation AI platform that ingests, processes, and structures **every** new piece of quantitative-finance research, including papers, news, blogs, and SEC filings into a **semantic knowledge graph**. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and research teams can now explore the frontier of factor strategies, risk models, and market insights in **seconds**, unlocking alpha that would otherwise remain buried.

### ‚ú® Why QuantMind?

The financial research landscape is overwhelming. Every day, hundreds of papers, articles, and reports are published. **QuantMind** solves this by:
The financial research landscape is overwhelming. Every day, hundreds of papers, articles, and reports are published.


#### üåê The Opportunity
- **Information Overload**: 500 new research papers & reports published daily. Manual review takes weeks‚Äîcostly, error-prone, and non-scalable  
- **Massive Market**: Financial data & analytics market ‚â´ expected to grow to US$961.89 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. Tens of thousands of quant teams & asset managers hungry for speed  
- **High ROI**: 1% improvement in research efficiency can translate to millions saved or earned in trading performance

#### üí° **QuantMind** solves this by:
- üîç **Extracting** structured knowledge from any source (PDFs, web pages, APIs)
- üß† **Understanding** content with domain-specific LLMs fine-tuned for finance
- üíæ **Storing** information in a semantic knowledge graph
- üöÄ **Retrieving** insights through natural language queries

### System Architecture

![quantmind-outline](assets/quantmind-stage-outline.png)

QuantMind is built on a decoupled, two-stage architecture. This design separates the concerns of data ingestion from intelligent retrieval, ensuring both robustness and flexibility.

#### **Stage 1: Knowledge Extraction**

This layer is responsible for collecting, parsing, and structuring raw information into standardized knowledge units.

```text
Source APIs (arXiv, News, Blogs) ‚Üí Intelligent Parser ‚Üí Workflow/Agent ‚Üí Structured Knowledge Base
```

- **Source**: Connects to various sources (academic APIs, news feeds, financial blogs, perplexity search source) to pull content
- **Parser**: Extracts text, tables, and figures from PDFs, HTML, and other formats
- **Tagger**: Automatically categorizes content into research areas and topics
- **Workflow/Agent**: Orchestrates the extraction pipeline with quality control and deduplication

#### **Stage 2: Intelligent Retrieval**

This layer transforms structured knowledge into actionable insights through various retrieval mechanisms.

```
Knowledge Base ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí Solution Scenarios (DeepResearch, RAG, Data MCP, ...)
```

- **Embedding Generation**: Converts knowledge units into high-dimensional vectors for semantic search

- Solution Scenarios: Multiple retrieval patterns including:

  - **DeepResearch**: Complex multi-hop reasoning across documents
  - **RAG**: Retrieval-augmented generation for Q&A
  - **Data MCP**: Structured data access protocols
  - Custom retrieval patterns based on use case

### üöÄ Quick Start

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable Python package management.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.8+
- Git

**Installation:**

1. **Install uv (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # On Windows
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

   # Or using pip
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LLMQuant/quant-mind.git
   cd quant-mind
   ```

3. **Create and activate virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   uv venv

   # Activate it
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

### üìö Usage Examples

#### Basic Paper Search and Processing

```python
from quantmind.sources import ArxivSource
from quantmind.storage import LocalStorage
from quantmind.config import ArxivSourceConfig, LocalStorageConfig

# Configure source and storage
arxiv_config = ArxivSourceConfig(max_results=10)
storage_config = LocalStorageConfig(storage_dir="./data")

# Initialize components
source = ArxivSource(config=arxiv_config)
storage = LocalStorage(config=storage_config)

# Search for papers
papers = source.search("machine learning finance")

# Store papers locally
storage.process_knowledges(papers)

# Display results
for paper in papers:
    print(f"Title: {paper.title}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(paper.authors)}")
    print(f"Categories: {', '.join(paper.categories)}")
```

#### Quant Paper Agent Example

### üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Better `flow` design for user-friendly usage
- [ ] First production level example (Quant Paper Agent)
- [ ] `tool` integration for more advanced usage
- [ ] Additional content sources (financial news, blogs, reports)
- [ ] Standardize the `knowledge` format (data standardization)

### The Vision: An Intelligent Research Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This section describes our long-term vision, not current capabilities.** While QuantMind today provides a solid knowledge extraction framework, the features described below represent our aspirational goals for future development.

QuantMind is designed with a larger vision: to become a comprehensive intelligence layer for all financial knowledge. We're building toward a system that understands the interconnections between academic research, market news, analyst reports, and social sentiment‚Äîcreating a unified knowledge base that powers better financial decisions.

The foundation we're building today‚Äîstarting with papers‚Äîwill expand to encompass the entire financial information ecosystem.

> [!NOTE]
> **Future Conceptual Example:**
>
> ```python
> # The future we are building towards
> from quantmind import KnowledgeBase, MemoryBank
> from quantmind.agents import PaperReader, NewsMonitor
> from quantmind.brain import understand, memorize, recall
>
> # Initialize the knowledge base
> kb = KnowledgeBase()
> kb.ingest(source="arxiv", topic="portfolio optimization")
>
> # Query for high-level insights
> insights = kb.query("latest trends in risk parity strategies")
> ```

This future state represents our commitment to moving beyond simple data aggregation and toward genuine machine intelligence in the financial domain.
